# FizzBuzz Demo

A twist on the usual FizzBuzz, to be create a frequency table of the number of times Fizz, Buzz or other appear.

I went for using a little Linq to make manipulating the collection flexible, without needing counters.

Seperation of the fizzbuzz code from NUnit for testing it.

Created using Visual Studio Code v1.30.2 and dotnetcore v2.2.103.
