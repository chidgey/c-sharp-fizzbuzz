# FizzBuzz Demo

A twist on the usual FizzBuzz, to be create a frequency table of the number of times Fizz, Buzz or other appear.

I went for using a little Linq to make manipulating the collection flexible, without needing counters.

Seperation of the fizzbuzz code from NUnit for testing it.

Created using Visual Studio Code v1.30.2 and dot net core v2.2.103, however the travis build is slighly behind targeting v2.1.502
